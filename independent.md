# Independent Study (Term 2)
Rohan Mishra

## Overview
This course is designed to give me the skills I need to implement my own dApp on Ethereum using
[Geth](), [Solidity](), and [Go]().

By the end of the course I will have a strong grasp of Go and Solidity, as well as
a concrete understanding of what blockchains are, their optimal use case. I will also have a 
deep understanding of how Ethereum works and the many-facitied concepts that comprise the
Ethereum blockchain.

## Competencies
By the end of this study, I will be able to:
- Understand what sets Go apart from other languages
- Implement arrays, linked-lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables in Go
- Utilize Go's inbuilt testing framework to test programs
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of concurrency and error-handing
- Build RESTful APIs and web apps in Go
- Interact with popular Javascript libraries in Go
- Understand the various developments in blockchain technology:
    + Cryptocurrencies
    + Smart contracts
    + Economics and markets
    + Science
    + Genomics
    + Health
- Synthesize an understanding of the limitations of the Blockchain technology
- Implement my own fork of the Etherum blockchain using `Geth`
- Build a very basic blockchain from scratch to serve as a database
