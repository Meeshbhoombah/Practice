# Independent Study (Term 2)
Rohan Mishra

## Overview
This course is designed to give me the skills I need to implement my own dApp on Ethereum 
using [Geth](), [Solidity](), and [Go]().

Upon completion of this course of the course I will have a strong grasp of Go and Solidity, 
as well as a concrete understanding of what blockchains are, their optimal use case. I will 
also have a deep understanding of both how Ethereum works and the concepts that comprise 
the Ethereum blockchain.

## Competencies
By the end of this study, I will be able to:
- Implement web apps/APIs in Go
- Demonstate what sets Go apart from other languages
- Maximize leverage of the Go toolkit and Standard Lib
